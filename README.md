Suggested by Wardle after a stunning round at the Silvermere. This app solves the problem he has with organising tennis club sessions. He runs sessions for up to 20 kids of different levels and he wants to be able to match them up based on grade. Currently his solution is pen and paper and sometimes an Excel spreadsheet, this can take up a lot of time and brainpower, so I thought I'd make his life easier. With a little (lot) help from GPT I could cook this project up pretty quickly. 

I also want to build this out to be a virtual assistant for the coach, not only an assistant tennis coach with features such as AI drill generator but also a scheduling assistant with features such as calendar integration and bulletin boards.

I am currently hosting this on pythonanywhere: www.coaches-hub.app
