Suggested by Wardle after a stunning round at the Silvermere. This app solves the problem he has with organising tennis club sessions. He runs sessions for up to 20 kids of different levels and he wants to be able to match them up based on grade. Currently his solution is pen and paper and sometimes an Excel spreadsheet, this can take up a lot of time and brainpower, so I thought I'd make his life easier. With a little (lot) help from GPT I could cook this project up pretty quickly. 

I am currently hosting this on pythonanywhere, I've put it behind a username and password so get hold of me if you want a sneak peek. https://jamierjhill.pythonanywhere.com/
